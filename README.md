[*SparkFun Tsunami Super WAV Trigger (Qwiic) (WIG-18159)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18159)

Tsunami is a polyphonic Wav file player with 4 stereo (or 8 mono) outputs.  Wav files can be triggered using the 16 onboard contacts, via MIDI, serial connection or Qwiic to a PC or other microcontroller.

Note, this Arduino Library is capable of controlling the Tsunami Super WAV Trigger (Qwiic) via I2C commands using a Qwiic Cable.
If you'd like to control your Tsunami using the Serial interface, then please check out the following separate Arduino Library here:
